$Role-Based Authorization for ASP.NET

ASP.NET RBAC Permission Management

Instructions:
This example extends Microsoft's ContosoUniversity program to implement resource-based permission management for all pages.

Key Features:

1.This is an upgraded version that no longer uses the external class reference Sang.AspNetCore.RoleBasedAuthorization.
2.When authorizing multiple roles for the same action, use [Authorize(Roles = nameof(Role.CoursesDelete) + "," + nameof(Role.CoursesRead))].
3.Added dynamic menu display functionality based on permissions.
4.Fixed the issue where Microsoft's default login interface actually uses the user's email address as the username.
5.Provides a unified interface for assigning, revoking, and verifying permissions, ensuring secure access based on role membership or direct user grants.

 
Technical Architecture:

Builds on ContosoUniversity's existing data model and UI.
Integrates role-based authorization via dependency injection and custom authorization handlers.
Extends Identity framework to support role-resource and user-resource mappings in the database.
